# CIND820-Big-Data-Analytics-Project - Data Mining for Customer Behaviour Analysis in Retail Sales WIP

# Project Overview

This project focuses on applying data mining techniques to retail transactional data to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior. The goal is to use market basket analysis, customer segmentation, and sales driver analysis to reveal insights and develop business recommendations that can support cross-selling strategies, customer targeting, and revenue optimization.

# Research Questions

1. What product combinations are most frequently purchased together, and which associations offer the greatest cross-selling potential?

2. Can customers be segmented based on purchasing behaviour (e.g., frequency, recency, monetary value, location), and what distinguishes high-value customers (customers generating most revenue/sales) to support targeted marketing and loyalty strategies?

3. What factors most strongly influence retail sales revenue and how can these insights inform pricing, promotion, and resource allocation strategies?

# Dataset Selection

Dataset: Online Retail Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Time Period: January 2010 to September 2011
Ket Fields: Invoice number, Stock code, Product description, Quantity purchased, Invoice date, Unit price, Customer ID, and Country of purchase.

The dataset selected for this project is the Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains transactional data for a UK-based online retail business that primarily sells unique all-occasion gifts.

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data cleaning and preprocessing will include removing transactions with missing CustomerID (for customer-level analyses), treating negative quantities as returns, imputing or removing missing entries, removing duplicate entries, standardizing capitalization/spelling, and feature engineering. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis will be conducted to understand the dataset: it will look at transaction volume, missing values, sales patterns, and trasaction volume.
